  ## Installation
  * This is a node.js project utilizing the command line interface.  I will require the installation of the inquirer and pg packages from the node library as well as dotenv for the use of the connection to the database of information.  The user will need to change out the .env.example file to just be .env and then will need to change the place holder variables inside that file to the provided credentials that will allow them to access the database.
    
  ## Usage
  The user will need to navigate to the command line terminal and enter node index.js and press enter.  The user will then be able to input a series of commands inside the command line interface that will be limited to choices manipulating the data inside the database.  
  These choices include 
  
  - view all departments
  - view all roles
  - view all employees
  - add role
  - add department
  - add employee
  - update employee role
  - update employee manager
  - view all employess by department
  - view all employees by manager
  - delete department
  - delete role
  - delete employee
  - view total budget of department
